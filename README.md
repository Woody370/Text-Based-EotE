- A very work-in-progress attempt at bringing the TTRPG to a text-based format!  

- Commits will be made to the core funtions, however I'll be uploading a Windows .exe as well  
for those who don't have WSL or VSC installed on their machines :)

# <p align="center"> === Character Creation ===</p>  
This will explain how character creation works **in this project.**  

## 1. Overview  

A character is defined by:  

- **Name**  
- **Species** (e.g. Human, Twi'Lek, Trandoshan, etc.)  
- **Career** (e.g. Bounty Hunter, Colonist, Smuggler, etc.)  
- **Characteristics** (e.g. Brawn, Agility, Intellect, etc.)  
- **Skills** (Career and Non-Career)
  - Career skills are skills that your character is proficient in due to the career you choose and offer 1 free Rank (better odds when rolling) in each skill. Non-Career are all other skills. In future builds, players will be given 6 Ranks to spend in their 8 Career skills, not going above 2 Ranks in any skill at character creation.  

## 2. Species  

When you create a character, you choose a **species** from a list.  

Each species has starting **characteristics**:  
- 'Brawn'
- 'Agility'
- 'Intellect'
- 'Cunning'
- 'Willpower'
- 'Presence'  

Currently, your species assings these starting values. However, future builds will allow a player to spend experience points to push these values higher. Higher values = better odds when rolling.
